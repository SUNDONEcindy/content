The `onChanged` event of the {{WebExtAPIRef("cookies")}} API fires when a cookie that the extension can access is set or removed.

> [!NOTE]
> When [storage partitioning](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/cookies#storage_partitioning) is active, `cookies.Cookie.partitionKey` contains the description of the cookie's storage partition. When modifying cookies, it's important to pass this value to {{WebExtAPIRef("cookies.set()")}} or {{WebExtAPIRef("cookies.remove()")}} to ensure the extension works with the correct cookie.

Note that updating a cookie's properties is implemented as a two step process:

1. First, the cookie to be updated is first removed, generating a notification with a {{WebExtAPIRef("cookies.OnChangedCause")}} of `overwrite`.
2. Next, a new cookie is written with the updated values, generating a second notification with a {{WebExtAPIRef("cookies.OnChangedCause")}} of `explicit`.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
browser.cookies.onChanged.addListener(listener)
browser.cookies.onChanged.removeListener(listener)
browser.cookies.onChanged.hasListener(listener)
```

This API is also available as `browser.cookies.onChanged.*`.

Events have three functions:

- `addListener(listener)`
  - : Adds a listener to this event.
- `removeListener(listener)`
  - : Stops listening to this event. The `listener` argument is the listener to remove.
- `hasListener(listener)`
  - : Checks whether `listener` is registered for this event. Returns `true` if it is listening, `false` otherwise.

## addListener syntax

### Parameters

- `listener`
  - : The function called when this event occurs. The function is passed these arguments:
    - `changeInfo`
      - : An `object` containing details of the change that occurred. Its properties are:
        - `removed`
          - : A `boolean` set to `true` if a cookie was removed and `false` if not.
        - `cookie`
          - : A {{WebExtAPIRef('cookies.Cookie')}} object containing information about the cookie that was set or removed.
        - `cause`
          - : A {{WebExtAPIRef('cookies.OnChangedCause')}} value representing the underlying reason behind the cookie's change.

## Examples

This example listens for `onChanged` events and logs details from the `changeInfo` argument:

```js
browser.cookies.onChanged.addListener((changeInfo) => {
  console.log(
    `Cookie changed: \n` +
      ` * Cookie: ${JSON.stringify(changeInfo.cookie)}\n` +
      ` * Cause: ${changeInfo.cause}\n` +
      ` * Removed: ${changeInfo.removed}`,
  );
});
```
